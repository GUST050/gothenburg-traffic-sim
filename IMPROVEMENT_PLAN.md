# Gothenburg Traffic Simulation Improvement Plan

**Date:** 2026-07-15 (consolidated)
**Status:** Canonical improvement plan — active implementation is in progress.
**Structural authority:** `ARCHITECTURE.md` remains the source of truth for
the six-stage pipeline and fixed contracts. This is the only improvement,
review, performance, simulation, closure, signal and sensor-growth plan.

## How To Use This Document

This document consolidates the former forward plan, program-improvement plan,
simulation accuracy/speed plans, code audit, destination-bias research, and
dated execution log. It retains the current conclusions and active work; it
does not preserve obsolete intermediate proposals as separate instructions.

1. Read `ARCHITECTURE.md` first for system structure and contracts.
2. Use this document for status, priorities, evidence gates and implementation
   order.
3. Treat an item as complete only when its acceptance gate and recorded
   measurement pass. A code change or green sensor GEH by itself is not enough.
4. Keep historical evidence in immutable run artifacts, tests, validation
   reports and Git history rather than duplicating it across planning files.

## Consolidated Status

### Foundations completed and retained

- Immutable run manifests, staged publication, per-seed health gates and
  durable job records prevent incomplete work from replacing active results.
- Run archiving is now scoped to the producing process: demand runs no longer
  glob stale closure routes from the shared `sumo/` directory, and scenario
  runs archive the exact scenario/trajectory they wrote instead of guessing
  from filesystem modification time. Run output records now include SHA-256
  content hashes. Golden releases live under `runs/releases/`, extending the
  existing run registry.
- Trajectory parsing includes SUMO reroutes in `routeDistribution`; unfinished
  vehicles and displayed-share integrity are explicit rather than silently
  omitted.
- The demand pipeline is split into modules, has a deterministic PFE benchmark
  fixture, per-variant fit gates, validation reporting and semantic speed
  benchmarks.
- Security hardening is in place for the local API: POST-only mutations,
  origin guard, CSP and safe dynamic result rendering.
- Sensor direction semantics now live in `data_in/sensors.json`, are validated
  before calibration, and participate in fingerprints.
- ScenarioSpec/ClosureSpec validation, time-windowed closures, paired closure
  comparisons, exhaustive candidate evaluation, network metadata and source-
  to-SUMO network auditing are implemented.
- New web closure and closure-time requests now carry the complete validated
  base/closure ScenarioSpec; `serve.py` archives it and invokes the runner
  with `--scenario-spec`. Legacy query requests remain only as a compatibility
  path during migration.
- Signal optimization now uses the same contract end to end: the browser
  sends the active scenario's full `ScenarioSpec`, the API archives and
  forwards it, and both plain and closure signal runners honor its exact seed
  set and demand-variant mapping. Legacy query requests remain supported for
  CLI/backward compatibility, but new UI jobs no longer reconstruct identity
  from loose edge/window parameters.
- Demand recalibration now uses a validated `DemandBuildSpec`: the browser/API
  archives the exact date, source, day range, effective window and structural
  reference; `build_sumo_demand.py` validates repeated legacy flags against it,
  writes `sumo/demand_build_spec.json`, and includes the contract plus all
  demand-affecting options in the content fingerprint. A matching
  `demand_build_key` is returned in job status and carried into `demand_meta`,
  so stale scenario sets cannot be mistaken for the requested calibration.
- Shared runtime code has been reorganized under `traffic_sim/` without
  breaking stable root CLI paths. Contracts, fingerprints, sensor intake,
  demand caching, SUMO metadata/runtime, disruption metrics, and run/release
  registries now each have one canonical implementation. Root compatibility
  imports contain no duplicate logic, and demand cache/build fingerprints hash
  the canonical package files.
- The browser supports focused normal, closure, closure-timing and synthetic
  signal-study workflows. Signal output already shows numeric timing changes
  with provenance.

### Active improvements, ordered by value and dependency

1. Finish purpose-compatible route allocation and revalidate normal demand.
2. Freeze and exercise a golden normal, closure and bounded micro-signal
   release, including rollback.
3. Complete SensorRegistry adoption through every API/UI entry point and add
   contribution/placement reports for each new station.
4. Formalize the generated synthetic SignalPlan and its phase/link safety
   certificate; then optimize closure-driven arrivals under that certificate.
5. Improve closure decision support with full feasibility, access, paired
   uncertainty and explicit queue/spillback gates.
6. Prove continuous multi-day demand and simulation semantics before exposing
   a multi-day result as one study.
7. Integrate reviewed NVDB structure data and retain provenance for every
   imported network value.
8. Build a unified study/job history view and later import one city-provided
   signal corridor with independent travel-time and turning evidence.

### Evidence-bound work that must not be faked

- Actual city controller plans, detector logic, movement conflicts, offsets,
  pedestrian/cycle timing and temporary work plans.
- Local link/path travel times, speed distributions, queue discharge and
  detailed lane-changing behaviour.
- Local OD, trip-purpose and through-traffic truth beyond what the six counts
  identify.

The absence of these data does not stop the current product. It limits claims:
citywide mesoscopic normal/closure results remain calibrated near sensors and
prior-driven elsewhere; signal results remain synthetic experiments until a
verified SignalPlan is imported.

## Consolidated Engineering Findings

### Demand, destinations and purposes

Six count stations constrain sensor crossings, not each vehicle's real origin,
destination or purpose. The previous candidate/PFE design could exploit that
underdetermination by selecting routes that ended immediately after a sensor.
The implemented response is retained as a permanent guard: joint natural
sensor-route sampling, destination naturalness masks, downstream-distance and
trip-length structure checks, near-sensor destination diagnostics, and
calibrated-output checks in addition to generated-pool checks.

The remaining improvement is not to relabel trips after calibration. It is a
purpose-compatible allocation or purpose-stratified calibration formulation
that makes the selected route instance compatible with purpose, departure time
and length before it is published. Until its incompatibility diagnostic is
zero, purpose labels are diagnostics rather than evidence of individual trip
intent. Through-traffic share remains a sensitivity-tested prior until a
cordon count or local OD source identifies it.

### Simulation integrity and closure realism

The former critical defects in rerouted-vehicle animation, missing unfinished
vehicles, fail-open health telemetry, stale route artifacts, unpaired closure
comparisons and closure window mismatch are resolved. Their protections stay
mandatory: final-route parsing, source-file reconciliation, per-seed health,
full input fingerprints, paired seed/variant comparisons and ScenarioSpec
window identity.

The remaining closure work is decision quality: apply access and detour gates
before ranking, evaluate all feasible windows when the candidate set is
bounded, reject low-delay results caused by lost traffic, and expose the
uncertainty/gate state rather than a single score.

### Performance and architecture

Measured performance work found the PFE's deliberately sequential
Gauss-Seidel update to be the dominant demand cost. Do not rewrite that solver
or reduce accuracy controls without a separate result-equivalence experiment.
The safe levers are complete input fingerprints, immutable candidate/network
caches, one process budget, isolated workspaces, reduced repeated I/O and
capturing required trajectory output during an existing seed run. Every
accepted speed-up requires semantic result comparison and a golden-case
before/after measurement.

### Active quality register

| Priority | Improvement | Completion evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | Freeze a normal, closure and micro-signal golden release | Complete health/provenance records, semantic hashes and tested rollback |
| P0 | Eliminate purpose-route incompatibility | Zero diagnostic across q10/q50/q90 plus no worse held-out/temporal result |

| P2 | City-configure one signal corridor | Imported plan plus independent turn/travel-time validation |
| P2 | Improve speed only with proof | Repeated benchmark improvement with unchanged semantic digest |

## Consolidation Coverage and Legacy Labels

The deleted review files are not lost work. Their actionable content is kept
in this plan at the following canonical locations:

| Former material | Canonical location here | Current handling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Full code and simulation audit | Foundations, quality register and Phases 0-7 | Resolved defects remain permanent gates; unresolved risks have a named owner and acceptance gate |
| Destination, purpose and sensor-endpoint research | Consolidated Engineering Findings and Phase 3 | Prevent endpoint-biased trips; complete purpose-compatible allocation before making purpose claims |
| Speed and robustness implementation plan | Phase 0 and Phase 7 | Accept only result-preserving speed work measured against golden cases |
| Multi-day, closure-timing and signal execution plan | Phase 3, Phase 4 and Phase 5 | Treat time ranges, closures and signals as one versioned study, not unrelated commands |
| Product and sensor-growth roadmap | Practical Development Roadmap and Phases 1-2/6 | Add evidence, provenance and user workflow before expanding scope |

Some source comments, tests, manifests and old run artifacts still carry
historic labels such as `A-D`, `E-K`, `P0`, or `SIM-P1`. They remain useful for
Git-history traceability only; they are not current task identifiers. For
future work, use the phases in this document: historical hygiene/performance
labels map to Phase 7, multi-day labels to Phase 3, closure labels to Phase 4,
signal labels to Phase 5, release/health labels to the completed foundations
plus Phase 0, and demand-science labels to Phase 3. Do not create a new plan
or a new implementation branch from a legacy label.

## Decision

This is the best path forward for the current project:

1. Keep the normal citywide simulation as calibrated, mesoscopic SUMO.
2. Make every normal run, closure run, closure recommendation, and signal
   study consume one exact versioned scenario definition.
3. Make sensor intake data-driven and prove the contribution of each new
   sensor instead of assuming that more data is automatically better.
4. Treat signal optimization as a phase-plan problem, not a collection of
   independent lamps. Use microscopic SUMO only where signal behavior must be
   judged.
5. Publish an answer only when its evidence and provenance are sufficient.

One engine cannot honestly provide both fast citywide flow estimates and
physical per-lane signal behavior. The correct product is one application
with two computation levels:

```text
SensorRegistry + versioned network
             |
             v
Calibrated DemandBuild (one build ID)
             |
             v
ScenarioSpec: normal case or exact closure schedule
             |
             v
Citywide mesoscopic SUMO
        |                         |
        v                         v
Closure decision engine     Signal study input: arrivals, reroutes,
                              affected controller set
                                      |
                                      v
                         Bounded microscopic signal evaluation
```

The user sees one coherent study and one result. Internally, the system uses
the least expensive model that can support each claim.

## Why This Order Is Necessary

The project already has strong foundations:

- Citywide mesoscopic simulation is fast enough for normal days and closure
  studies, with calibrated demand, uncertainty variants, health telemetry,
  build fingerprints, and scenario publication gates.
- Time-windowed road closures and a closure-time screener already exist.
- A signal experiment framework exists for normal and closed-road cases.
- The web application already has focused workspaces rather than a single
  overloaded screen.

There are also foundation gaps that should be resolved before adding more
heuristics:

- New sensor direction metadata historically lived in `build_data.py`
  (`SENSOR_MEASURED_DIRECTION`); it is now sourced from the validated
  `data_in/sensors.json` registry. The hard-won verification workflow (check
  the city's trafikmängder catalogue FIRST; the delivered "Total" label was
  wrong for 4 of 5 sensors) is now represented by explicit registry fields,
  not only by prose.
- Structural products can be stale after a sensor change if cache identity
  does not include the sensor registry and all relevant inputs.
- The closure-time feature defaults to a proxy-selected subset of windows for
  fast exploration. `--exhaustive` now evaluates every feasible window; only
  that mode may claim that it searched the global feasible set.
- The ordinary signal baseline is generated by `netconvert --tls.guess`.
  It is not a real Gothenburg controller plan, so synthetic timing results
  must not be presented as operational instructions.
- Legacy signal requests default to 07:00-09:00, but spec-driven signal
  studies now take their measurement window and closure interval from the
  shared ScenarioSpec. A selected time-windowed closure therefore cannot
  silently be optimized for a different period.
- The latest demand diagnostics record purpose-route incompatibility. Until
  this is resolved, trip-purpose labels are useful diagnostics, not proof of
  the real purpose of every simulated vehicle.

Already in place — do NOT rebuild these, extend them (verified against the
working tree 2026-07-15):

- Trajectory reconciliation is complete: `final_route()` reads rerouted
  vehicles from `<routeDistribution>`, unfinished vehicles park visibly,
  and the artifact withholds itself below 98% source-file integrity. Any
  deliberately non-drawable path remains visible in the published
  `displayed_share` diagnostic rather than being silently lost.
- Health telemetry fails closed (a missing per-seed statistics file flags
  the build), and the E2 publisher refuses any flagged baseline.
- Build-ID equality and per-variant (q10/q50/q90) fit gating in the
  publish gate are implemented in the current working tree
  (`validate_staged_scenarios`); the canonical fingerprint and candidate
  cache implementations now live under `traffic_sim/` and are included in
  invalidation keys.
- An immutable run registry (`runs/<id>/` manifests, `latest_*` pointers,
  `/api/jobs` durable records with orphan reconciliation) exists — the
  release structure in Phase 0/1 must be an EXTENSION of it, never a
  second registry.
- The assembled per-build validation report (`web/data/validation.json` +
  the 🛡 panel) exists; Phase 6's study view builds on it.
- A results-preserving speed benchmark harness exists
  (`make benchmark-speed`, semantic hashes).
- Security hardening is done: mutating endpoints are POST-only with an
  Origin-based CSRF guard, CSP without inline scripts, reflected-XSS fix.

## Product Outcome

The finished program should provide four connected outputs from the same
release:

| User task | Input | Output | Claim level |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Normal traffic | Date, historical or forecast source | Citywide 15-minute flow, representative vehicles, confidence | Calibrated near sensors; prior-driven where unmeasured |
| Road closure | Exact road directions and time window | Rerouted citywide flow, delay, access loss, confidence | Fast mesoscopic incident study |
| Best closure time | Closure requirement and permitted windows | Least disruptive feasible schedule, alternatives, uncertainty | Simulation-backed decision support |
| Signal timing | Normal or closure ScenarioSpec plus SignalPlan | Green/red seconds per phase, cycle, offset, queues, comparison to baseline | Synthetic experiment or city-configured recommendation, stated explicitly |

## Practical Development Roadmap

This section and the numbered Phases later in the document describe the SAME
work from two angles — read them this way, or their numbering will mislead:

- **Stages (this section)** are the product narrative: what the user can
  trust, in which order, and why.
- **Phases 0-7 (below)** are the engineering work-packages with acceptance
  gates. The **canonical execution order is the phase order** in
  "Recommended Implementation Order" at the end.

Mapping, so no executor has to reconstruct it:

| Stage | Built from phases |
| --- | --- |
| 1 Normal baseline trusted | 0 (freeze) + 3 (demand realism) |
| 2 Closure as incident study | 1 (ScenarioSpec) + 4 (decision engine) |
| 3 Signals on closure traffic | 5 (synthetic study, steps 1-4) |
| 4 Sensors prove their value | 1 (SensorRegistry) + 2 |
| 5 Physical network inputs | 3 (network realism) |
| 6 One city-configured corridor | 5 (steps 5-6, blocked on city data) |
| 7 Scale under gates | 7 |

A later stage may use an earlier stage's artifact only after that artifact
has passed its stated gate.

### Stage 1: Make normal traffic the trusted baseline

**Do now, without new external data.** Finish purpose-compatible route
allocation, retain exact time-of-day and day-type demand, and rerun temporal
holdout plus leave-one-sensor-out validation. Keep the existing structural
checks for route length, route diversity, onward distance after a sensor, and
near-sensor destinations. Freeze one normal golden day only after all q10/
q50/q90 variants pass their own fit and health gates.

**Why first:** a closure or signal optimizer can only be as credible as the
normal traffic it compares against.

**Exit condition:** the baseline has a content-addressed build ID, a validated
normal scenario, a reproducible validation report, and no purpose-level claim
when purpose compatibility fails.

### Stage 2: Make road-closure simulation a proper incident study

**Do next, using the trusted normal build.** Every closure must be one exact
ScenarioSpec: directed edge IDs, active start/end, duration, permitted-access
exceptions, analysis window, demand build, network build, seed set, and
direction-variant mapping. Use the same seed/variant pairs for the normal
baseline and the closure so differences are caused by the closure rather than
Monte Carlo noise.

For each closure, the engine must:

1. verify that the selected road directions and closure interval are exactly
   what SUMO receives;
2. check topology before simulation, including detour existence, access loss,
   and whether an affected movement can become stranded;
3. reroute traffic through the full city graph, not only the visible map;
4. measure closed-edge leakage, dropped/truncated vehicles, teleports,
   unfinished vehicles, added distance, paired delay, throughput and queue/
   spillback proxy;
5. reject a superficially fast result when it obtained that result by losing
   access or dropping vehicles;
6. publish the changed flows, route consequences, uncertainty and explicit
   health gates alongside the map animation.

Use mesoscopic SUMO citywide for speed and coverage. Use a bounded
microscopic component only around the affected junctions when queue, lane,
roundabout or signal claims are needed. Do not turn the whole city
microscopic.

**Exit condition:** a closure result is reproducible, has no integrity or
health failure, and clearly distinguishes "lower delay" from "least harmful
overall". A closure-time recommendation uses `--exhaustive` for a bounded
candidate set, or explicitly says that it is only a screened subset.

### Stage 3: Optimize signals for the actual closure traffic

**Works now as a synthetic experiment.** Take the exact closure ScenarioSpec
from Stage 2, use its actual rerouted arrivals, and optimise only the legal
phase structure. The optimizer may change cycle, phase green budget, legal
yellow/all-red/red-yellow and offset; it may not create new simultaneous
greens. Compare candidate and baseline with identical warm-up, measurement,
drain, seeds and demand variants.

Publish numeric timings per controller/link and a paired delay comparison.
The candidate is rejected when it harms a hard safety/access/health gate,
creates spillback, or is not robust across uncertainty variants. While the
phase structure is generated from SUMO, label it `synthetic`; it is an
experiment, not an instruction to operate a city controller.

**Exit condition:** every timing result identifies its SignalPlan,
ScenarioSpec, timing window, provenance, safety status and comparison.

### Stage 4: Let every new sensor make a measured difference

**Do continuously as sensors arrive.** Add data through `data_in/` and the
SensorRegistry, never through a source-code constant. Validate station ID,
raw columns, timestamp coverage, count units, directional semantics,
coordinate CRS, bearing, snap distance, counterpart direction and active
period before calibration. A sensor must overlap the study date; future-only
data cannot validate a historical 2025 simulation.

After each addition rebuild features, direction splits, observability, bounds,
priors, forecast inputs, demand and validation. Publish a contribution report:
the new measured edges, coverage, confidence change, holdout recovery,
affected closure corridors, and `improved`, `neutral`, or `insufficient
evidence`. Prefer new directional counters on signal approaches and detour
routes, where they can change a closure/signal decision rather than merely
duplicate an existing count.

**Exit condition:** no sensor can enter calibration without a validated
registry record, and its contribution is measured rather than assumed.

### Stage 5: Improve physical network inputs without inventing observations

Use public sources such as NVDB only for documented road structure: speed
limits, lanes, road class and prohibited directions. Reconcile them against
the stable edge-ID mapping, record imported/defaulted/manual provenance in
the network audit, and repair only reviewed mismatches. Do not calibrate
driving speed, lane changing or queue discharge from speed limits alone.

**Exit condition:** every network value used by SUMO is traceable to OSM,
NVDB, a reviewed override, or a declared fallback.

### Stage 6: Upgrade one corridor with city-provided evidence

When data access becomes possible, choose one signal corridor affected by a
realistic closure. Import its real controller plan, phase/movement mapping,
conflict and clearance matrices, pedestrian/cycle constraints, detector and
transit-priority rules, offsets, approach/turn counts and matching travel
times. Map and validate the package against the SUMO network before using it.

This upgrades that corridor from `synthetic` to `city-configured`; it does not
silently make the rest of the city equally accurate. Use it to validate the
synthetic model and decide whether its assumptions are useful elsewhere.

**Exit condition:** one corridor can reproduce its real signal plan and has
independent arrival/travel-time evidence for normal and closure evaluation.

### Stage 7: Scale only after the evidence gates pass

Expand sensor coverage, controller imports and closure scope incrementally.
Preserve performance by caching immutable fingerprinted artifacts, using a
measured process budget, and retaining citywide meso as the default. Every
speed claim requires a golden-case before/after measurement and semantic
result comparison. Never gain speed by dropping seeds, uncertainty variants,
rerouter coverage or solver work.

### What the user can do at each stage

| Stage reached | User-visible capability | Honest limitation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Simulate normal traffic with calibrated sensor evidence and confidence | Unmeasured streets remain prior-driven |
| 2 | Close one or more roads and compare rerouted delay, access and confidence | Queue detail is limited outside micro study areas |
| 3 | See green/red numbers for normal or closure traffic | Synthetic controller phases until city plans are imported |
| 4 | Add a sensor through data/registry and see its measured benefit | More sensors help where they add independent information |
| 5 | Trust that speeds/lanes/turn rules trace to a named source | Free-flow structure only — never observed driving behaviour |
| 6 | Receive city-configured timings for one validated corridor | Does not validate every other junction automatically |
| 7 | Larger sensor sets and more corridors at the same trust level | Growth is gated — each expansion re-proves its gates |

## Non-Negotiable Rules

- Keep stable edge IDs, WGS84, absolute time, `null != 0`, and the browser
  `flowAt(edgeId, t)` seam.
- Every artifact must carry the exact demand build ID, network fingerprint,
  random seeds, direction variants, tool version, and source provenance.
- Do not make a run faster by reducing seeds, variants, solver iterations,
  rerouter coverage, or mesoscopic fidelity.
- A sensor count is measured evidence. A learned prior, mathematical bound,
  and simulated result must remain distinguishable in the UI and output.
- A failed or incomplete job must never replace the currently published
  release.
- A signal result may only be called a recommendation when its plan provenance
  and safety gates permit that claim.

## Phase 0: Freeze a Reference Release

**Purpose:** Establish one reproducible baseline before changing behavior.

### Work

1. Commit the already validated accuracy, robustness, and speed work as one
   named release.
2. Freeze three golden cases under that release — pinned to the exact
   inputs the repo already validates against, so the baseline is the
   system's own proven state rather than a new arbitrary one:
   - normal historical full day: **2025-09-16** (the structural reference
     date; the LOSO baseline, the PFE benchmark fixture, and every
     structure-gate number on record were measured against it);
   - a known-detour full-day closure: **Skånegatan two-edge closure**
     (60786979_3575001205_0 + 1455801464_18241874_0 — the closure whose
     rerouting, truncation, and leak behaviour is already documented);
   - one bounded microscopic signal smoke case.
3. Record semantic hashes, run time, peak memory, build ID, network hash,
   route artifacts, variant fit, seed health, closure integrity, and
   trajectory reconciliation.
4. Keep the golden artifacts and their manifest separate from normal pytest
   timing tests. Build the release directory as an extension of the
   EXISTING `runs/` registry (same manifest conventions, same atomic
   `latest` pointer mechanism) — two parallel registries is how artifacts
   get separated from their provenance again.
5. The release pointer must be reversible: rolling back to the previous
   golden release is one pointer flip, exercised once as part of this
   phase (an untested rollback is not a rollback).

### Acceptance gate

- The full test suite passes.
- Each golden case has a complete health record and no publication gate
  failure.
- A refactor intended to preserve results matches the semantic baseline.

## Phase 1: Shared Versioned Contracts

**Purpose:** Prevent normal, closure, and signal paths from using different
definitions of the same study.

### New artifacts

#### `SensorRegistry`

Store it as the versioned machine-readable file `data_in/sensors.json`. It
must contain at least:

```text
sensor_id
active_from, active_to
measurement_semantics: directional | two_way_total
measured_bearing or permitted_bearings
coordinates and coordinate_reference_system
source and source_file identifier
snap_status, approved_edge_ids, snap_distance_m
catalogue_verification: status, date, verifier   # trafikmängder catalogue
quality_status and notes
```

The registry, not a Python constant, becomes the source of truth for sensor
direction semantics (it absorbs `SENSOR_MEASURED_DIRECTION`). Manual
overrides remain possible, but must be explicit registry records with a
reason and reviewer marker. `catalogue_verification` encodes the project's
hardest-won intake lesson as a field instead of folklore: the delivered
"Total" label was wrong for 4 of 5 sensors and was only caught by checking
the city's own trafikmängder catalogue — a sensor whose semantics have not
been verified against the catalogue must not reach calibration.

#### `ScenarioSpec`

One versioned object must be consumed by `run_scenario.py`,
`suggest_closure_time.py`, `signal_optimize.py`, `signal_closure_combine.py`,
`serve.py`, and the browser:

```text
scenario_id
demand_build_id
network_build_id
start_time, end_time
closures: [ClosureSpec]
simulation_mode
seed_set and demand_variant mapping
analysis_window: warmup_s, measure_start, measure_end, drain_s   # optional
objective_profile
signal_plan_id or no_signal_plan
```

`ClosureSpec` contains directed edge IDs, active start/end time, closure type,
and any permitted-access exceptions. No feature may recreate a closure from a
different fixed time window.

`analysis_window` exists because the accuracy review found signal studies
that started with an empty network at 07:00 and stopped abruptly: any
bounded evaluation must state its warm-up, its measured period, and its
drain explicitly, IN the spec — not as per-tool constants — so a
07:00-09:00 signal request can never silently mean "green splits from
07:00-08:00, offsets from the whole day, evaluated over two cold hours".

#### `SignalPlan`

This is the only input accepted by a signal study:

```text
signal_plan_id, network_build_id, provenance
controller/TLS mapping, link-index mapping
movement and conflict definitions
phase states and compatible movements
cycle, green, yellow, all-red, red-yellow, offset
min/max timing constraints
pedestrian, cycle, transit, emergency, and detector rules
day type and active time range
```

Until a verified city plan exists, the provenance must be `synthetic` and the
UI must describe the result as an experiment, not an operational instruction.

#### `DecisionResult`

The closure and signal tools should return a shared result envelope with the
input IDs, alternatives tested, objective metrics, uncertainty, gates,
provenance, and a machine-readable recommendation status.

### Implementation rules

1. Use dataclasses or typed validation functions at every file/API boundary.
2. Include all schemas and all sensor metadata in content fingerprints.
3. Reject a build if an artifact required by its job type is absent: a registry
   entry/snap approval where sensor calibration is used, a route artifact where
   routes are consumed, a SignalPlan for a signal study, or a matching build ID
   whenever artifacts are combined.
4. Keep backward-compatible CLI shims while migrating callers one by one.

### Acceptance gate

- A normal, closure, and signal job loaded from the same ScenarioSpec report
  identical date/window/closure identity.
- A selected 13:00-15:00 closure cannot accidentally produce a 07:00-09:00
  signal study.
- A stale observability, bounds, prior, or signal artifact is rejected rather
  than reused.

## Phase 2: Sensor Growth That Proves Its Value

**Purpose:** Let the city add sensors without source-code edits and make the
accuracy benefit visible.

### Intake workflow

1. Validate raw CSV columns, timestamps, count units, active period, missing
   quarters, duplicate records, impossible negative values, and station IDs.
2. Validate every registry entry against the network: distance to geometry,
   direction/bearing, two-way counterpart when applicable, edge uniqueness,
   and lane/road-class plausibility.
3. Fail closed for an unknown sensor or ambiguous directional meaning. A warning
   is not enough because an incorrectly snapped count corrupts calibration.
4. Rebuild features, direction split, observability, bounds, corridor priors,
   assignment priors, forecast inputs, demand, baseline, and validation from
   the new release fingerprint.
5. Preserve the old release until the replacement satisfies all gates.

### Sensor contribution report

For every added sensor, publish:

- its data-quality and snap report;
- measured edges and time coverage;
- bounds narrowed by the sensor;
- leave-one-sensor-out and temporal holdout results before and after addition;
- confidence reduction by edge and by incident-relevant corridor;
- forecast impact once sufficient history exists;
- a clear `improved`, `neutral`, or `insufficient evidence` conclusion.

The LOSO mechanism already exists (`validate_sim.py`, calibrating each fold
with the exact deployed constraint set) — this phase reuses it per added
sensor rather than building new machinery; the temporal holdout is the new
piece. One documented interpretation rule carries over from the G1
investigation: a fold ratio near zero can measure the sensor's
INFORMATIONAL ISOLATION (nothing else constrains its corridor — sensor
1076 sits at 0.05 for exactly this reason, proven by a controlled pre-fix
rerun), not model error. The contribution report must therefore always
pair a recovery number with the sensor's isolation context before
concluding `improved` or `neutral`.

More sensors should improve the estimate where they add independent information.
The program must not falsely promise that one poorly located or low-quality
sensor improves every road in the city.

### Sensor placement guide

Rank prospective locations by expected information gain, combining:

- wide observability bounds;
- low current confidence;
- network connectivity and corridor coverage;
- closure-critical detour corridors;
- complementarity with existing sensors;
- practical station data quality and directional observability.

### Acceptance gate

- A new station can be added through data and registry metadata only.
- Its addition forces a new fingerprinted build.
- The map shows both the added measurement and its actual confidence impact.

## Phase 3: Improve Normal Citywide Realism

**Purpose:** Improve what the default simulation means before making more
decisions from it.

### Demand and validation work

1. Aggregate the exact-day departure shape per physical station, not per
   directed edge, so a two-direction station does not receive double weight.
2. Make purpose compatible with the selected route instance. The proper fix is
   a purpose-aware route allocation or a purpose-stratified PFE formulation,
   benchmarked against the current solver. Do not simply relabel incompatible
   routes after solving. (The current length-aware post-solve allocation
   preserves P(length|purpose) and the exact purpose×time mix but current
   q10/q50/q90 diagnostics report at least one provenance-incompatible
   allocation in all 96 quarters. Do not quote a vehicle-share percentage
   until a versioned artifact calculates it; this item must drive the
   incompatibility diagnostic to zero. The H2 benchmark fixture exists
   precisely so a solver-formulation change here cannot silently alter
   results.)
3. Surface purpose compatibility in the validation report and block claims
   about purpose-specific behavior when the diagnostic fails.
4. Rerun leave-one-sensor-out validation and temporal holdouts after each
   substantive demand change, and update the recorded honest baseline
   (currently min 0.05 / median 0.78 / max 1.95, measured 2026-07-13 —
   quoting any older number is a documentation bug). Sensor GEH is
   calibration fit, not independent validation.
5. Keep structure gates for trip length, near-sensor destinations, onward
   distance after the last sensor, route diversity, and unserviceable counts.

### Multi-day simulation

The current trusted unit is one complete local calendar day. A multi-day study
must not be implemented by concatenating independent daily outputs or by
silently resetting the network at midnight. Build it only after a two-day
continuous prototype proves the following contract:

1. `ScenarioSpec` and demand metadata carry an explicit local-date range,
   time zone, ordered analysis windows and the exact source selected for each
   day. Internally use monotonic simulation seconds; retain ISO datetimes with
   offsets for artifact identity and browser display.
2. Produce one monotonically departed route set across the entire range.
   Vehicles still active at midnight remain accounted for into the next day;
   no vehicle is dropped merely because its departure date changes.
3. Preserve the correct day-of-week, holiday and forecast/historical profile
   for every 15-minute interval. The known DST gaps remain `null`/explicit
   gaps, never invented zero traffic or a duplicated hour.
4. Calibrate and health-check each date and direction variant separately, then
   publish one range-level manifest that links all daily diagnostics. Do not
   let a good first day hide a failed later day.
5. Aggregate flows by absolute timestamp and day, retain boundary-vehicle,
   unfinished and route-error accounting, and make trajectory export opt-in
   or sampled for multi-day runs so the browser and disk footprint stay
   bounded.
6. Add cancellation, disk-budget and process-budget tests before permitting a
   multi-day API request. A longer study must not block ordinary one-day work
   or overwrite its artifacts.

**Acceptance gate:** a frozen two-continuous-day normal case has monotonic
time, correct local calendar labels, per-day q10/q50/q90 fit and health,
explicit midnight carry-over accounting, no missing interval silently read as
zero, and a result-equivalence comparison against the two single-day
reference studies except for the explicitly measured boundary carry-over.

### Network realism work

1. Build a source-to-SUMO network audit sidecar for speed, lane direction,
   turn lanes, turn restrictions, priority, traffic-signal membership, and
   roundabout membership.
2. Retain source provenance for each value: imported, defaulted, or manually
   reviewed.
3. Repair only reviewed network issues while preserving the stable edge-ID
   mapping layer.
4. Use OSM/default speeds as free-flow constraints. Do not tune vehicle
   behavior, lane changing, or speed factors without held-out speed/travel-time
   observations.

### Confidence work

Replace a single unexplained confidence number with components for measured
evidence, mathematical bounds, held-out error, demand uncertainty, and
Monte Carlo stability. Keep the simple map presentation, but allow the user
to inspect why an edge is uncertain.

### Acceptance gate

- All q10/q50/q90 variants pass their own fit, structural, and health gates.
- Purpose incompatibility is zero or explicitly blocks purpose-level claims.
- The new release is no worse on frozen temporal and held-out validation.

## Phase 4: Make Road-Closure Advice a Real Decision Engine

**Purpose:** Answer "when should this road be closed?" as a constrained,
auditable decision rather than a low-flow guess.

### Candidate definition

The user supplies road directions, closure duration, permitted dates/times,
access requirements, and optional operational restrictions. The engine builds
all feasible 15-minute-aligned windows within that scope.

### Feasibility screen

Reject or flag a candidate before ranking when it has:

- no network detour for affected movements;
- unacceptable lost access or stranded trips;
- closed-edge leakage;
- health failure, excessive teleporting, or excessive unfinished vehicles;
- an incompatible ScenarioSpec or stale baseline;
- policy constraints such as emergency, public transport, pedestrian, or
  construction restrictions when those inputs are available.

### Evaluation

1. Reuse the exact normal demand build and same seed-to-variant mapping.
2. Compare each candidate against its matched baseline seed/variant pair.
   Do not compare a candidate only to a baseline mean when pairing exists.
3. Prefer exhaustive simulation of all feasible windows for a bounded
   one-day study, after measuring the candidate grid. A closure spanning
   `d` 15-minute intervals permits `96 - d + 1` start slots within a day;
   the measured whole-day 3-seed meso closure costs ~40 s, but actual
   runtime also depends on closure geometry and candidate count. Benchmark
   multi-day demand separately before promising an overnight result. A
   proxy may prioritize work, but it must never be presented as proof of
   the best global choice.
4. Use bounded independent SUMO processes only after the benchmark confirms
   that the selected worker count is faster and result-equivalent.
5. Score expected and worst-case delay, added distance, rerouted vehicles,
   access loss, stranded/truncated trips, queue/spillback proxy, closure
   integrity, and confidence. A short time loss caused by dropping access is
   not a good outcome.

### Result

Return a ranked feasible set, a clear best candidate only when it is robust,
and `no viable closure` when every option violates a hard gate. If the top
alternatives overlap under uncertainty, show that there is no clear winner.

### Acceptance gate

- The reported closure schedule is exactly the schedule simulated.
- Every eligible candidate uses matched seeds/variants and the same demand
  build.
- The result distinguishes lowest delay from least harmful overall outcome.

## Phase 5: Build a Defensible Signal Optimizer

**Purpose:** Produce actual green/red values in a way that preserves safety
and reflects normal or closure traffic.

### Usable now: the current synthetic signal study

This feature is already useful without waiting for a new data delivery. The
user selects a normal scenario or an exact road-closure scenario; the program
uses the same demand build, closure interval, seeds, and direction variants;
then it runs microscopic SUMO signal experiments against the rerouted traffic.
For a closure, the two-pass study first drives the closure with the baseline
program, extracts the trips that actually rerouted, and optimizes/evaluates
the signal timings against those post-closure trips. The UI already reports
numeric cycle, offset, green, yellow, and red seconds per controlled link.

The present source of phase compatibility is `netconvert --tls.guess`, so the
result must be labelled **synthetic experiment**. It answers: "within this
network model and these conservative timing rules, which green splits reduce
the simulated delay after this closure?" It does not answer: "change
Gothenburg's controller to these values." The distinction is a claim gate,
not a reason to withhold the useful simulated result.

### Execution order: useful now, then city-configured

1. **Freeze the current synthetic study.** Keep the existing normal and
   closure paths (`signal_optimize.py` and `signal_closure_combine.py`) as the
   usable product. Every result must identify `synthetic` provenance, the
   exact ScenarioSpec, the closure's active interval, the measured window,
   seed/variant pairs, and whether it passed health and closure-integrity
   gates.
2. **Make a versioned synthetic SignalPlan.** Export the generated TLS
   topology, link mapping, phase states, compatible-movement sets, timing
   limits, and clearance values to a `SignalPlan` artifact. Preserve the
   generated phase structure; never infer a new simultaneous green merely
   because two movements have high demand. Reject a junction whose generated
   link map or phase sequence cannot be reconciled with the SUMO network.
3. **Optimize the closure's actual arrivals.** Use the closure ScenarioSpec
   rather than a fixed time window. Run citywide meso once for demand/reroute
   context; use micro only for the affected signal component and its queues.
   Optimise cycle, phase green budget, legal clearance, and offsets jointly.
   A higher flow may receive a longer green, but only after competing phases,
   pedestrian/cycle minimums, and spillback guards are evaluated.
4. **Publish an honest numeric result.** For every controller show baseline
   versus candidate green/red/yellow/all-red, the affected movements, paired
   delay change, queue/spillback/health state, and `no valid improvement`
   when the candidate is unsafe, disqualified, or not robust across q10/q50/
   q90 demand variants.
5. **Import one real junction cluster before scaling.** Build an adapter from
   the city's documents into the same SignalPlan schema, run mapping and
   safety checks, and compare synthetic versus imported plans on the same
   normal and closure scenarios. Do not import citywide plans first: one
   reviewed corridor is the correct acceptance gate.
6. **Promote only verified plans.** `city-configured` is allowed only when
   every controller/link/phase mapping, conflict matrix, clearance, detector
   rule, and active time plan is present and valid. Otherwise keep
   `synthetic` even if the numerical result looks attractive.

### Sensor growth and signal accuracy

A new sensor improves this workflow by narrowing the calibrated traffic
arrivals, not by directly revealing a green split. The most valuable future
sensors are directional counters on approaches to the selected signal cluster
and on likely detour routes before and after a closure. A station must overlap
the simulated date and be added through the registry with its coordinate CRS,
measurement semantics, direction/bearing, active dates, raw-file identity,
and approved edge snap. After every addition, rebuild all derived artifacts
and publish a before/after contribution report: holdout recovery, confidence
change, affected movement demand, and whether the signal recommendation
changed. A sensor added after the historical date may improve future studies;
it must not be silently used as evidence for a 2025 historical run.

### Verified data position: what is available, what is only city-held

The table below deliberately separates evidence that is publicly confirmed
from data that the city is likely to manage but has not committed to deliver.
"City-held" means the documented signal process requires or uses the artifact;
it does **not** mean that this project is automatically entitled to receive
it.

| Data | Status on 2026-07-15 | Use now | Needed for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Supplied 2025 six-sensor, 15-minute counts | Present in this project | Calibrate current normal and closure demand | Current simulation |
| Göteborg traffic catalogue: counts, average speeds, nearby flow measurements from 2019 onward | Public interactive catalogue; no bulk/API delivery is assumed | Manual/approved external reasonableness checks only | Extra validation, not calibration replacement |
| NVDB lane counts, speed limits, functional class, forbidden direction and road network | Publicly documented API data; download requires registration | Network audit and legal/free-flow constraints | Better routing structure, not observed travel speed |
| Signal plans, conflict/spärrtid matrices, signal-group functions, detector functions, plan selection and priority rules | City signal process requires these documents; no public per-controller dataset was found | Not yet | Real controller-compatible timing |
| Historical link/path travel times and detector logs | A city/Trafikverket travel-time camera system is documented, but no current public historical export was verified | Not yet | Validate speeds, queues and signal effects |
| Turning counts at signal approaches | Not publicly verified | Not yet | Validate left/through/right demand |
| Local OD/purpose microdata | Not open data; SCB access is a project-specific, reviewed order | Not needed for the current synthetic study | Stronger OD and purpose claims |

Sources: Göteborg's public catalogue explicitly exposes traffic volumes,
average speeds and nearby measurements, but as an interactive report rather
than a promised bulk feed ([Göteborg traffic catalogue](https://goteborg.se/wps/portal/start/trafik-och-resor/trafik-och-gator/trafikinformation/statistik-om-trafiken-i-goteborg/trafikmangder-pa-olika-gator)).
Trafikverket documents NVDB's available lane, speed-limit and forbidden-
direction datasets and its registration requirement for downloads
([NVDB open API](https://bransch.trafikverket.se/tjanster/data-kartor-och-geodatatjanster/nyheter-om-trafikverkets-data/2025/nvdb-vagdata-tillgangliga-i-trafikverkets-datautbytesportal-for-anvandning-i-oppet-api/)).
Göteborg's current technical handbook requires conflict and clearance matrices,
signal-group functions, detector functions and plan-selection/priority
descriptions for traffic-signal work
([signal requirements](https://tekniskhandbok.goteborg.se/12-projektering/12b-projekteringsforutsattningar/12bh-trafiksignaler/)).
It also documents travel-time cameras operated jointly with Trafikverket, but
the available public page is archival and does not establish a current raw-data
service ([travel-time system](https://tekniskhandbok.goteborg.se/Arkiv/2015-1/__site/__planering__planeringsf%C3%B6ruts%C3%A4ttningar__grunddata__restider.html)).
SCB confirms that microdata requires a defined research/statistics project and
a confidentiality review ([SCB microdata](https://www.scb.se/vara-tjanster/bestall-data-och-statistik/mikrodata/)).

### Exact request to send when data becomes possible

Ask the city for **one selected signal corridor**, not the whole city. Request
the following for one normal weekday and the planned closure period: controller
and junction IDs; signal-group-to-SUMO-movement mapping or drawings; active
time plans; phase sequence; conflict and clearance/spärrtid matrices; minimum/
maximum green, yellow, all-red and red-yellow; pedestrian/cycle constraints;
detector and transit-priority logic; offsets/coordination; temporary work-plan
rules; 5- or 15-minute approach/turn counts; and matching link/path travel
times. Ask separately whether the city can license a historical extract for
research. This is the smallest package that upgrades one corridor from a
synthetic experiment to a defensible city-configured study.

### Optimization model

1. Optimize legal **phases**, each a set of compatible movements that can be
   green simultaneously. Never optimize each lamp separately.
2. Preserve conflict-free phase structure from SignalPlan.
3. Choose cycle length, phase green split, yellow, all-red/red-yellow,
   offsets, and plan switching by time of day within legal min/max limits.
4. Use arrivals and movement demand derived from the exact normal or closure
   ScenarioSpec. A closure study must receive the actual closure edges and
   active times, not a fixed default window.
5. Evaluate a normal and closure plan against their own real baseline plan
   using equal warm-up, measurement, drain, seeds, variants, and network.
6. Optimize a robust objective: total and percentile delay, stops, queue
   length, spillback, throughput, transit/pedestrian constraints, and
   robustness across demand variants.

### Fidelity and performance rule

Use citywide meso to create normal/closure flows and identify affected signal
components. Use bounded microscopic evaluation for signal phases, queues,
lane use, and roundabouts. This can remain invisible to the user as an
implementation detail, but the result must state its model and area.

### Result shown to the user

For each controller and time period, show:

```text
baseline plan and provenance
cycle length and offset
phase name and compatible movements
green, yellow, all-red/red-yellow, and resulting red seconds
normal or closure ScenarioSpec identifier
paired baseline comparison and uncertainty
queue/spillback/safety status
```

### Acceptance gate

- No conflicting protected greens or invalid clearance timing.
- The actual scenario window, closure schedule, plan ID, and demand build ID
  match exactly.
- No health, access, closure-integrity, or spillback gate fails.
- A candidate is selected only when it robustly improves on the baseline;
  otherwise publish `no valid improvement`.

## Phase 6: One Application, Not Separate Tools

The existing task-oriented UI should remain. Do not rebuild it as another
landing page. Instead, make every task open a shared study context.

### Required behavior

1. Normal simulation selects a DemandBuild.
2. Road closure creates a ScenarioSpec from that build.
3. Closure timing creates candidate ScenarioSpecs from that same build.
4. Selecting a closure recommendation loads that exact ScenarioSpec.
5. Signal optimization consumes the selected ScenarioSpec and its exact time
   window.
6. The validation panel follows the active build and scenario.
7. A job page shows progress, cancellation, logs, artifacts, confidence, and
   final gates for each study.

Every result page must make three things immediately visible: what was run,
whether it completed healthily, and what the result is allowed to claim.

### Acceptance gate

- From any result page, the operator can reach the exact ScenarioSpec,
  build ID, job record, and validation report that produced it, without
  reading server logs.
- The 🛡 validation panel reflects the ACTIVE study's build, not merely
  the latest demand build.
- A cancelled or failed study leaves the previous published study visible
  and clearly labelled as the one still in force.

## Phase 7: Maintain Performance Without Reducing Fidelity

The performance policy is result preservation first.

1. Continue using the benchmark harness and semantic hashes for normal,
   closure, and microscopic smoke cases.
2. Keep citywide meso as the default for normal and closure work.
3. Cache only immutable, fully fingerprinted artifacts such as candidate
   geometry, network metadata, and validated signal plans.
4. Use isolated workspaces and a single process budget for candidate/seed
   batches. Do not overlap PFE workers with SUMO workers.
5. Promote parallel seed or candidate execution only after repeated measured
   trials show a material wall-time improvement with identical results.
6. Keep detailed vehicle, lane, and queue output limited to the selected
   signal study so citywide runs do not produce unnecessary I/O.

Do not reduce seed count, uncertainty variants, solver iterations, closure
rerouter coverage, or simulation step fidelity as a speed shortcut.

One measured performance boundary to respect (2026-07-14): the dominant demand
cost is the deliberately sequential per-edge IPF update, already
flat-parallel across all cores — 96% of solve time with no safe lever
short of a JIT dependency. Performance work under this plan means caching,
scheduling, and I/O discipline, not touching the solver.

### Acceptance gate

- Every claimed speed-up ships with before/after wall time on a golden
  case AND an identical semantic hash (or a documented, reviewed reason
  the results changed).
- No cache is keyed on anything less than the full build fingerprint.

## External Data Requests (one consolidated list)

Four standing requests gate the highest rungs of this plan. Ask for them
together, through Miroslaw, as one package — each names exactly what it
unlocks:

1. **City signal controller plans** (phase diagrams, timings, detectors,
   priority rules — the exact one-corridor package is spelled out in
   Phase 5's "Exact request to send" section): unlocks `city-configured`
   signal recommendations; until then every signal result stays labelled
   synthetic.
2. **A cordon count for the inner city** (all gates, one day): the only
   measurement that identifies the through-traffic share — currently a
   supply-tuned prior with a documented sensitivity sweep in
   "Consolidated Engineering Findings." Unlocks a calibrated E-E/E-I/I-I
   composition and a stronger OD-matrix claim.
3. **RVU Västra Götaland microdata** (or a regional OD matrix): upgrades
   the purpose×length priors from shrunk national ratios to local
   estimates (Phase 3), and gives the purpose-compatibility work a ground
   truth to validate against.
4. **Time-stamped link travel-time or speed observations** (normal and, if
   available, incident periods): unlock local road-speed calibration,
   travel-time validation, and evidence for queue and roundabout claims.

## Recommended Implementation Order

```text
0. Freeze reference release                                   (size S–M)  — executes AFTER the 1/2 migration
                                                                            completes: freeze the migrated state,
                                                                            not a mid-migration snapshot
1. SensorRegistry + content-aware invalidation                (size M)  ◐ registry and package migration complete;
                                                                          DemandBuildSpec and recalibration identity are now in;
                                                                          finish stale-artifact rejection proof across every publication path
2. ScenarioSpec/ClosureSpec + API migration                   (size L)  ◐ closure, closure-time, signal and recalibration API/browser paths migrated;
                                                                          legacy query forms remain compatibility shims only
3. Normal demand realism and validation repairs               (size M–L)
4. Closure decision engine, paired feasible evaluation        (size L)  ◐ --exhaustive window evaluation exists
5. SignalPlan import/audit and synthetic-plan containment     (size M; import blocked on city data)
6. Real or explicitly synthetic phase optimization            (size L)
7. Unified study UI and job history                           (size M)
8. Expand sensor coverage and signal scope only after each gate passes
```

(Sizes: S ≤ half a day, M ≈ a day, L = multi-day.
◐ = partially done as of 2026-07-15; the markers are status, not a licence
to skip the phase's remaining items or its acceptance gate.)

The immediate next implementation block is therefore: **prove stale-artifact
rejection end to end** (including a deliberately mismatched archived
`DemandBuildSpec`/scenario set), then **Phase 0's freeze** on top of the
migrated state, then **Phase 3's purpose-compatibility work** — the largest
remaining honesty gap in the demand model. Send the
external data request package (see above) at the START of the block — the
city's response time, not our implementation time, is the critical path for
Phase 5's top rung.

## Definition of Success

The project has reached its intended next level when:

- a new sensor is added through a validated data record, triggers a new build,
  and reports the uncertainty it actually reduces;
- normal and closure simulations share one validated demand release;
- the closure tool can explain whether a road should be closed, when, and why
  a candidate is rejected or uncertain;
- the signal tool provides phase-level green/red seconds for both normal and
  closure demand, with the signal plan provenance made explicit;
- all results remain fast enough for the intended workflow without hiding
  model limitations;
- the user can inspect the exact evidence behind every recommendation.

## Explicitly Deferred Until Evidence Exists

- Claiming that synthetic SUMO signals are Gothenburg's actual controllers.
- Calibrating car-following, lane-changing, queue tails, or road-speed
  distributions without independent local speed/travel-time data.
- Claiming that every added sensor improves every edge rather than measuring
  its actual information contribution.
- Replacing the fast citywide mesoscopic model with citywide microscopic
  simulation.
